# JPEGAA  -  Illustrating image degradation from multiple JPEG encoding cycles
The JPEGAA application (JPEG Ad Absurdum) illustrates the degradation of an image resulting from multiple iterations of
JPEG encoding.

Edit the run settings in the rt/Config/JPEGAA.xml file.
Run the application from the rt/bin sub-directory.
Output logs will be written to the rt/Logs sub-directory.
Output images will be written to the rt/images sub-directory.

The default Configuration (in Config/JPEGAA.xml) is set to use rt/images/CIMG-2X3.gif as a base image and
will perform 30 cycles of encoding.
